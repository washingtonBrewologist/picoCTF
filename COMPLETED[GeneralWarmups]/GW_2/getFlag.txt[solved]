-Can you convert the number 27 (base 10) to binary (base 2)?

[Solution]
	
	We can use the python script we just wrote in our other General Warmup
	and just change one or two things and it should be working fine.

	#!/bin/bash/env python

	# Will display Binary value for given decimal value
	print "picoCTF{%s}" % bin(27)
 -Note we are given back a binary sequence with a '0b' prefix. the prefix is NOT
  part of the binary value of 27.

[Flag]

	picoCTF{11011}
