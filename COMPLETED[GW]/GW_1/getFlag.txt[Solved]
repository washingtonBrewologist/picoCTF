 If I told you your grade was 0x41 in hexadecimal, what would it be in ASCII? 

[Solution]

We could of course look on the web for a hex -> ASCII Calculator but thats
not what were here to do. The goal is to automate process that can be automated
whenever possible.

[Possible solutions]

1. Open Python and enter the hex number directly into the interpreter, In 
our case the hex# is 0x41. Python lets us know this is 65 in decimal. Now if
you wanted to look at your ASCII table, it would a breeze to find the ASCII
for the number 65. 

0x41 in HEX == 65 Decimal == 'A' ASCII


2. A cooler way to solve this would be to write a simple python script.

	2a. Create getFlag.py and open in an editor
	2b. The scipt will look like this:

	#!/bin/bash/env python

	# Will display ASCII value for given hex
	print "picoCTF{%s}" % chr(0x41)
	
	2c. Run the script and you should get the following output
	picoCTF{A}


[Solution]

picoCTF{A}
