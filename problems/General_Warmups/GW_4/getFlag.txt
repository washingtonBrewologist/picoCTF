We put together a bunch of resources to help you out on 
our website! If you go over there, you might even find a 
flag! 	
	https://picoctf.com/resources

[Solution]

	insted of just opening the website lets use wget and grep to get
	what we came for.

	1.) we can use the wget command to scrape the HTML of the website
	    which will contain the flag were after. We also want to redirect
	    the output to a file we'll call resourcesHTML.

	2.) wget 'https://picoctf.com/resources' > resourcesHTML


	3.) Next to avoid having to dig through all of this html for
	    our flag we can use grep to do it for us.

		cat resourcesHTML | grep picoCTF{ resourcesHTML
	
comandFlow ->->	 cat the file, pipe it to grep. grep searches this file
		 for the string picoCTG{* 

		(* indicates any thing after)
